We operate 15 schools serving over 4,500 students in the Bay Area and Washington state. Historically, 98 percent of Summit graduates are accepted to four-year colleges, and Summit graduates complete college at double the national average.We need exceptional, diverse, and mission-aligned teachers to join our team to help prepare our students for a fulfilled life. Join us!Summit’s Expeditions Program:The areas of study, or clusters, which students can explore include Leadership & Social Change, Health and Wellness, Media Studies, Technology, Business, and Art, Design & Engineering. Over the course of their time at Summit, students have the opportunity to explore passions across these clusters or to craft a pathway of deep study that may lead to an internship or independent study.In particular, our middle and high schools are interested in teachers who can offer courses in one of the following areas:Computer ScienceVisual Art STEM EducationThe Expeditions team seeks teachers with a passion for these areas who can design and execute courses in that cluster based on the teacher’s experience and expertise, aimed at middle and high school students. Using the Framework for 21st Century Learning (P21. 2015, May), students should master the skills, knowledge and expertise to succeed in work and life in the 21st century.The role of the Expeditions teacher is to empower students to discover and deepen their passions, as well as serve as a mentor to a group of students they will follow throughout their time in middle and high school. We believe that connecting to one’s passion is crucial for success in college and a career, as this allows students to make better choices about “best fit” colleges based on an understanding of the course of study for possible careers. They can begin college with a career goal in mind that is connected to their passion, and can immediately apply their decision-making and self-direction skills to continuously set and achieve goals. With their own passions and fields of study as expertise, Expeditions Teachers execute this vision by doing the following:Summit Expeditions teachers design and teach a high-quality, challenging, project-based curriculum that guides students towards explorations of potential passions.Summit Expeditions teachers facilitate learning experiences which lead students through deep exploration of fields of study connected to potential majors, hobbies and careers.Summit Expeditions teachers design and guide students through real-life experiences in the field, through guest speakers, field trips, and other connections to community groups.Collaboration & Professional Development - Twice a week, teachers participate in all-faculty after-school meetings where community decisions are made, professional development takes place, and faculty collaborates as a grade-level team or subject-level team. Mentor Time - Build deep relationships and a sense of community when teachers meet with their small group of mentees daily for their entire time at Summit.

        "position": "Social Worker",
        "company": "Unity Preparatory Charter School of Brooklyn",
        "description": "Our Social Workers are absolutely essential to our success as a faculty and school. They manage a wide variety of student needs, ensuring that barriers to student learning are identified and that supports are put in place for our students and families. In doing so, they guide our students to be empowered, critical, and engaged members of their school, their community, and the world at large. Overview of Unity - Our Model and Approach: Unity Preparatory Charter School of Brooklyn (Unity) is a tuition-free, open-enrollment, independent charter school that offers a progressive education in the liberal arts & sciences to over 600 students in grades 6-12. As a community-based school, we proudly serve the communities of central Brooklyn in New York City. Our middle school and high school campuses are located in the neighborhoods of Bedford Stuyvesant and Williamsburg, respectively.  Unity’s mission is to empower students as scholars and citizens so they may lead fulfilling academic, personal, and professional lives. We accomplish our mission through the integration of seven key elements that serve as the backbone of our school’s design. Collectively, these elements reflect our beliefs on what makes for an exceptional secondary education in today’s world: 1.    A Grades 6-12 College Preparatory Curriculum:​ a college-preparatory liberal arts and sciences program of study in mathematics, English language arts (ELA), science, and history that fosters in students the desire and capacity to learn independently, think critically, and communicate proficiently so that they are fully prepared to succeed in their postsecondary studies 2.    Excellent Teaching:​ ​​an enthusiastic faculty of expert educators who are demonstrably successful in promoting student learning, couple high expectations with high support, go above and beyond the call of duty for students as scholars and as citizens, and serve as role models for students as life-long learners and as individuals who take the utmost pride in perfecting their craft 3.    More Time for Learning:​ ​​an extended day, week, and year that provide approximately 20% more time than the local district average for academic enrichment and extracurricular activities that deepen learning and engagement, accelerate academic growth, and expose students to new pursuits 4.    Intensive and Differentiated Academic Support:​ customized settings and support provided by caring specialists for remediation and acceleration, including small class sizes, integrated co-teaching, literacy interventions, after-school and weekend tutoring, as well as advanced-level course offerings at our middle school and high school 5.    Ample Enrichment Courses and Extra-Curricular Activities:​ enrichment courses in the performing arts, visual arts, computer science, and foreign languages, as well as elective clubs, athletic teams, internships, and other “beyond-the-classroom” activities that serve to reinforce what students learn in their core courses, accommodate individual student interests, and develop important professional and citizenship skills through real-world, meaningful application 6.    A Positive and Supportive School Culture:​ ​​a culture built on a framework of Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports (PBIS) in which compassionate adults explicitly guide students in the following: o      modeling the behaviors that contribute to a positive and productive learning environmento      developing socio-emotional skills needed to be successful, including how to manage emotions, reduce stress, make healthy decisions, and learn from one’s mistakes 7.    Active Family and Community Involvement: ample opportunities for family engagement and community service that promotes open communication, meaningful collaboration, and active involvement and service within Unity’s community and beyond Our Recent Accomplishments: Regardless of where students are academically or otherwise as they enter our school, our focus is on accelerating growth and on cultivating long-term academic and non-academic success. This focus has reaped impressive results for our students and families in recent years. Among our accomplishments:●     Our 8th grade students have consistently outperformed their district peers in mathematics and ELA on state exams.●     Our students who comprise subgroups that are traditionally least effectively served by our education system, including students classified as economically disadvantaged, black, Latino, and students with disabilities, have consistently outperformed their district and state peers on state exams.●     Approximately 75% of our high school upperclassmen enroll in at least one Advanced Placement (AP) course each year. This compares favorably with the 33% of NYC graduates who enroll in AP courses during their high school tenure.●     In holding true to our belief in providing a truly empowering education:o      90% of our students participated in an afternoon extra-curricular activity.o      80% of our students participated in a formal community service initiative.o      90% of students successfully completed their end-of-year Roundtable presentation, a 45-minute oral presentation given to families, Unity faculty, and community members.o      100% of high school students completed a full-year course in college and career readiness.ResponsibilitiesOur faculty plays an essential role in establishing Unity as a model educational institution. Most critically, faculty members equip students with the knowledge and skills needed – including the desire and capacity to learn independently, think critically, and communicate proficiently – in order to experience secondary and postsecondary success.
