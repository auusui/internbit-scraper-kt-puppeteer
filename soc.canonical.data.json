It was encouraging and rewarding to see my managers make use of my contributions for further analysis, presentations, and decision-making. My colleagues considered all my thoughts, making for a collaborative environment.\"Stephen, Operations - \"Having the opportunity to partake in MassMutuals Early Career Internship Program really opened my eyes to the corporate world and also helped me dismiss what I had previously heard about working at a Fortune 100 company. Everyone I encountered during my internship was willing to teach, help, mentor, or simply say \"Hi\". Every day I learned both new soft skills and technical skills, and I was able to notice my own progression as the summer went on. I was continually given the same work my colleagues were doing, so I was able to gain real Fortune 100 working experience in just one summer.\"Nithya, Marketing \"This summer has been such an amazing experience. My manager and mentor gave me projects that allowed me to truly make a lasting impact. The fact that I was doing important work really meant a lot to me, and I saw tangible results come out of my projects. The structure and support that the Early Career Program provides is also unparalleled. The Early Career Program team really cared about our professional and personal development, giving us the opportunity to participate in professional learning and networking opportunities throughout the summer. From this summer, I have discovered what I want to pursue in the career ahead of me, and for that I am beyond grateful to ECP and all the people that make it happen.\"Committed to Diversity and InclusionOur employees are the embodiment of the idea that we all are stronger and better through our support for one another.
